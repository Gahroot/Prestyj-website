**Why they got featured:** These listicles feature tools with documented results, clear pricing, and unique differentiators (Ylopo emphasizes "50M+ conversation training").

**How to replicate WITHOUT outreach:**

- Publish case studies on your blog with specific metrics
- List on software directories (see #4) - listicle authors pull from these
- Create comparison pages (e.g., "Prestyj vs Human ISAs") that rank for "[competitor] alternative"
