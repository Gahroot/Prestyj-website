You get a new lead notification. You're at a showing, so you'll call back in an hour. By then, that lead has already talked to three other agents.

This isn't speculation. It's data.

## The Numbers Don't Lie

A study by Lead Response Management found that contacting a lead within 5 minutes is **21 times more effective** than waiting 30 minutes.

But here's the kicker: only 27% of leads ever get contacted at all. The rest? They're calling your competitors.

## Why Speed Matters More Than Ever

Today's buyers expect instant responses. They've been trained by Amazon, Uber, and DoorDash to expect immediate gratification.

When they submit a lead form, they're motivated *right now*. Every minute you wait, their motivation drops.

## The 47-Second Standard

Top-performing real estate teams respond to leads in under a minute. Not an hour. Not 30 minutes. Under 60 seconds.

They're not superhuman. They're using AI-powered systems that respond instantly while they focus on showings and closings.

## What Fast Response Looks Like

1. **Lead comes in at 9:47 PM** (you're at dinner with family)
2. **AI responds at 9:47 PM** with a personalized text
3. **Qualification happens** while you finish dessert
4. **Appointment is booked** before you get the check
5. **You wake up** to a qualified appointment on your calendar

That's the power of speed-to-lead done right.

## The Cost of Slow Response

Every slow response is a potential $10,000+ commission walking out the door. Multiply that by 10 missed leads per month.

Can you afford to keep responding slowly?
