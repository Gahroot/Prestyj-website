## What's in This Playbook?

**Answer: Everything you need to stop missing $15,000 storm jobs.**

Every roofing contractor faces the same problem: Storm hits → phones explode → crews on roofs can't answer → homeowners call whoever answers first → you lose jobs you should have won.

This playbook shows you exactly how to fix it.

### Chapter 1: The Economics of Speed

Why being first to respond matters more than reviews, reputation, or price:

| Response Time | Lead Capture Rate |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Under 60 seconds | 85%+ |
| 1-5 minutes | 60-70% |
| 5-15 minutes | 30-50% |
| 15+ minutes | 10-25% |

**The cost of one missed storm call:** $15,000 average job value.

**The cost of one storm day with poor response:** $285,000+ in lost revenue.

### Chapter 2: The 60-Second Standard

What "fast" actually looks like for roofing contractors:

- Immediate answer (no voicemail, no rings wasted)
- Conversational qualification (not scripts)
- Appointment booking capability
- Emergency detection and routing
- 100% uptime reliability

**Real example from the playbook:**

> **Caller:** "Hi, I think we have hail damage from the storm last night."
>
> **AI Response (37 seconds later):** "Thanks for calling Apex Roofing. I'm sorry to hear you may have damage—those storms were pretty intense. Are you seeing any active leaks inside the house, or is it mainly exterior damage you've noticed so far?"

**Result:** Lead captured, appointment booked, human crew preserved for actual work.

### Chapter 3: Emergency Triage Protocols

Not all storm calls are equal. The playbook shows you how to implement a three-tier system:

**TIER 1: Immediate Emergency (Dispatch Within 1 Hour)**
- Active water intrusion
- Structural failure
- Tree on roof
- Roof deck exposed

**TIER 2: Priority (Same-Day Inspection)**
- Significant storm damage (hail, wind)
- Insurance claim already filed
- Older customers with history

**TIER 3: Standard (Next-Available Inspection)**
- Cosmetic damage only
- Informational calls
- New construction estimates

### Chapter 4: After-Hours Response Strategy

> **40%+ of storm calls come in outside business hours.**

The playbook covers:

- **Evening (5 PM - 10 PM):** Answer, qualify, offer next-day appointments
- **Overnight (10 PM - 6 AM):** Answer, qualify, flag for morning review
- **Weekends:** Full qualification and booking, emergency dispatch if urgent

**Sample script from the playbook:**

> "Thanks for calling Apex Roofing. I know it's after hours, but storm damage doesn't wait—let me help you right now. Are you calling about damage from today's weather?"

### Chapter 5: Multi-Channel Follow-Up

Speed isn't just about the first call—it's about persistent engagement:

- **Immediate (0-5 minutes):** Phone call answered, qualification, booking
- **Confirmation (5-15 minutes):** SMS + email with appointment details
- **Reminder (24 hours before):** SMS confirmation
- **Day-of:** SMS "Crew en route" updates
- **Post-appointment:** Follow-up sequences

### Chapter 6: CRM Integration Guide

Data silos kill efficiency. The playbook includes:

- Required data fields for every lead
- Integration checklist for common roofing CRMs
- Two-way sync requirements
- Common pitfalls to avoid

**Supported systems covered:** JobNimbus, AccuLynx, Roofr, ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro

### Chapter 7: Implementation Checklist

A complete 8-week rollout plan:

**Week 1-2:** Planning (business requirements, technical requirements, vendor selection)
**Week 3-4:** Setup (system configuration, team preparation)
**Week 5-6:** Pilot (test with 20-30% of leads, monitor, iterate)
**Week 7-8:** Full rollout (scale to 100%, optimize)

### Chapter 8: ROI Calculator

Fill in your numbers and calculate:

- Current revenue from storm leads
- Projected revenue with AI response
- Revenue increase opportunity
- Payback timeline

**Typical result:** $135,000-945,000/month incremental revenue, with 30-60 day payback.

### Chapter 9: Vendor Selection Criteria

What to look for (and what to avoid) when choosing an AI response vendor:

**Must-haves:**
- Sub-60-second response time
- Natural conversation capability
- Emergency triage
- Calendar integration
- CRM integration
- 24/7 availability
- Roofing-specific knowledge

**Red flags:**
- Fixed call capacity (will still get overwhelmed)
- Per-minute pricing only (costs explode during surge)
- Generic platform (not tuned for roofing)
- Long implementation time
- No emergency handling
