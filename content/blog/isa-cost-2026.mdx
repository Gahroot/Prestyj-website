Hiring an ISA seems straightforward until you add up the real numbers. Most agents underestimate the true cost by 40-60%.

**TL;DR:** A full-time real estate ISA costs $65,000-$120,000 annually when you factor in salary, benefits, training, tools, and turnover. AI alternatives deliver comparable results at 5-10% of that cost with zero ramp-up time and 24/7 availability.

## Key Takeaways

- **Base salary alone is $40,000-$60,000** for a competent ISA in 2026, before any additional costs
- **Hidden costs add 40-60%** on top of salary when you include benefits, training, tools, and management time
- **Average ISA turnover is 18-24 months**, meaning you'll repeat hiring and training costs frequently
- **AI-powered solutions cost $500-$2,000/month** and work around the clock without sick days or turnover

## The Base Salary Reality

Let's start with what you'll pay an ISA directly. In 2026, the market looks like this:

### Entry-Level ISA (0-1 Years Experience)
- **Base salary:** $35,000-$45,000
- **Commission:** 5-10% of team commission on closed deals
- **Total compensation:** $45,000-$65,000

### Experienced ISA (2+ Years)
- **Base salary:** $45,000-$60,000
- **Commission:** 10-15% of team commission
- **Total compensation:** $65,000-$90,000

### Top-Tier ISA (Proven Track Record)
- **Base salary:** $55,000-$75,000
- **Commission:** 15-25% of team commission
- **Total compensation:** $85,000-$150,000+

These numbers vary by market. ISAs in San Francisco, New York, or Miami command 20-30% higher salaries than those in smaller metros.

## The Hidden Costs Most Agents Miss

Here's where the real expenses hide.

### Benefits Package (Add 20-30%)

A competitive benefits package includes:

| Benefit | Annual Cost |
|---------|-------------|
| Health insurance | $6,000-$12,000 |
| Dental/Vision | $1,200-$2,400 |
| 401(k) match | $1,500-$3,000 |
| Paid time off | $3,000-$5,000 |
| **Total** | **$11,700-$22,400** |

Without benefits, you'll struggle to attract quality candidates. The ISAs willing to work without benefits are usually the ones you don't want.

### Training and Ramp-Up (3-6 Months)

New ISAs don't produce on day one. Expect:

- **Training period:** 2-4 weeks of intensive onboarding
- **Ramp-up time:** 3-6 months to reach full productivity
- **Your time investment:** 5-10 hours/week managing them initially

During ramp-up, you're paying full salary for 30-50% productivity. That's $15,000-$25,000 in "lost" productivity costs.

### Tools and Technology

Your ISA needs:

| Tool | Monthly Cost |
|------|--------------|
| CRM seat | $50-$200 |
| Dialer system | $100-$300 |
| Lead lists | $200-$500 |
| Phone/Computer | $50-$100 |
| **Monthly Total** | **$400-$1,100** |
| **Annual Total** | **$4,800-$13,200** |

### Management Overhead

Someone has to manage your ISA. That's either you (opportunity cost) or a team leader (direct cost). Budget 5-10 hours per week of management time, worth $2,500-$5,000 monthly in opportunity cost.

## The Turnover Problem

Here's the number that kills most ISA ROI calculations: **average ISA tenure is 18-24 months.**

When your ISA leaves, you lose:

- **Hiring costs:** $2,000-$5,000 in recruiting, interviewing, background checks
- **Training investment:** Everything you taught them walks out the door
- **Productivity gap:** 4-8 weeks to hire, 3-6 months to ramp up a replacement
- **Lead leakage:** Leads falling through cracks during transition

Many teams cycle through 2-3 ISAs before finding one that sticks. Each turnover costs $15,000-$30,000 in direct and indirect expenses.

## Total Cost of Ownership: The Real Numbers

Let's calculate the true annual cost of a mid-level ISA:

| Category | Annual Cost |
|----------|-------------|
| Base salary | $50,000 |
| Commission (estimated) | $15,000 |
| Benefits | $15,000 |
| Tools/Technology | $8,000 |
| Management time | $12,000 |
| Training (amortized) | $5,000 |
| Turnover cost (amortized) | $10,000 |
| **True Annual Cost** | **$115,000** |

That's the real number. Not the $50,000 salary you budgeted.

## AI Alternatives: The 2026 Comparison

AI-powered ISA solutions have matured significantly. Here's how they compare:

### AI ISA Advantages
- **Cost:** $500-$2,000/month ($6,000-$24,000/year)
- **Availability:** 24/7/365, no sick days or vacations
- **Response time:** Under 60 seconds, every time
- **Scalability:** Handle unlimited concurrent conversations
- **Consistency:** Same quality at 9 AM and 9 PM

### Where Human ISAs Still Win
- Complex objection handling requiring empathy
- Building deep personal rapport over months
- Navigating unique or unusual situations
- Reading between the lines on motivation

### The Hybrid Approach

Top-performing teams in 2026 use both:

1. **AI handles initial response and qualification** (24/7)
2. **Human ISA takes warm, qualified leads** during business hours
3. **Result:** Lower human ISA workload, higher conversion rates

This approach typically costs 40-50% less than full human coverage while improving response times.

## FAQ

### Is it worth hiring an ISA in 2026?

It depends on your volume. If you're generating 50+ leads per month and can afford the true $80,000-$120,000 annual cost, a human ISA can be worth it. For lower volumes, AI solutions often deliver better ROI.

### Can I pay an ISA commission-only?

You'll get what you pay for. Commission-only ISAs typically underperform, churn quickly, and may not prioritize your leads over other income sources. A reasonable base plus commission produces the best results.

### How long before an ISA becomes profitable?

Expect 4-6 months before a new ISA reaches break-even productivity. Full ROI typically takes 12-18 months, assuming they stay that long.

### What's the biggest mistake when hiring an ISA?

Underestimating total costs and expecting immediate results. Budget for the full cost (not just salary) and plan for a 6-month ramp-up period.
