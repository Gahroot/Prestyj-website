Hurricane hits. Phones start ringing. 100 calls per hour become 1,000. Your restoration company is overwhelmed—missed calls mean lost jobs worth $5K-50K each.

Property restoration is a storm-driven business. When disaster strikes, call volume explodes 10-50x. Staff can't keep up. Jobs go to competitors who answer faster.

**TL;DR:** AI consultants help property restoration companies automate storm surge response—capturing every lead, triaging emergencies, and scheduling inspections 24/7. During major events, AI handles unlimited call volume while your crews focus on mitigation. Implementation takes 2-4 weeks with ROI achieved in the first storm.

## Key Takeaways

- **Storm surge automation:** AI handles 10-50x normal call volume during disasters
- **Emergency triage:** AI identifies catastrophic losses for immediate dispatch
- **Unlimited capacity:** No missed calls during peak events
- **Implementation:** 2-4 weeks to deploy, faster before storm season
- **ROI:** One additional job per storm pays for the entire system
- **Specialization:** Restoration-specific workflows (insurance documentation, emergency priority)

---

## Why Property Restoration Needs AI

### The Storm Surge Problem

**Normal volume:** 50-100 calls/day
**Storm volume:** 500-5,000 calls/day
**Your capacity:** 3-5 staff answering phones
**Result:** 80%+ missed calls during critical first 48 hours

**The math:**
- Average water damage job: $5,000
- Average fire job: $25,000
- Missed calls during major storm: 1,000+
- Lost revenue: $5M-25M in a single event

### Restoration-Specific Challenges

**Emergency Triage:**
- "Water pouring from ceiling" → Dispatch immediately (cat 1 loss)
- "Slight smell of smoke" → Schedule inspection tomorrow (cat 3 loss)
- AI must understand urgency and prioritize correctly

**Insurance Documentation:**
- Policy number collection
- Loss description documentation
- Photo intake coordination
- Adjuster communication preparation

**Crew Coordination:**
- Emergency dispatch vs. scheduled inspections
- Crew location tracking
- Job priority management
- Equipment availability

**Seasonal Spikes:**
- Hurricane season (June-November)
- Wildfire season (varies by region)
- Winter storm season (December-March)
- Each requires instant capacity scaling

## What AI Does for Restoration Companies

### 1. Instant Storm Response

**Every call answered in under 60 seconds:**
- No busy signals
- No voicemail (homeowners hang up and call next company)
- No holding (disaster victims are impatient)
- First responder advantage (78% work with first company they reach)

**24/7 availability:**
- Storms don't follow business hours
- 3 AM calls from panicked homeowners
- Weekend events when offices are closed
- Holiday disasters

**Unlimited capacity:**
- 100 calls/hour? Handled.
- 1,000 calls/hour? Handled.
- AI scales infinitely during surge events

### 2. Emergency Triage

**AI asks the right questions:**
- "Is water actively leaking?" → Yes = emergency dispatch
- "How large is the affected area?" → 1,000+ sqft = priority dispatch
- "Is everyone safe?" → No = emergency services first
- "Do you have standing water?" → Yes = emergency mitigation

**Priority routing:**
- Cat 1 (emergency): Dispatch crews immediately
- Cat 2 (urgent): Schedule within 4 hours
- Cat 3 (standard): Schedule within 24 hours
- Cat 4 (minor): Schedule within 48 hours

**Documentation for claims:**
- Policy number
- Date and time of loss
- Cause of loss (wind, flood, fire, etc.)
- Preliminary damage description
- Photo collection instructions

### 3. Inspection Scheduling

**Automated booking:**
- Qualified leads book directly into job management software
- Crew territories matched to job location
- Equipment requirements identified upfront
- Customer confirmations sent via SMS

**Crew optimization:**
- Minimize travel time between jobs
- Maximize jobs per crew per day
- Emergency jobs inserted intelligently
- Residential vs. commercial crew routing

### 4. Multi-Channel Coordination

**Phone answered:**
- AI handles initial call
- Collects key information
- Provides reassurance ("help is on the way")

**SMS confirmation:**
- "Restoration ABC scheduled your inspection for [date/time] at [address]"
- "Crew [name] is en route, ETA [time]"
- "What to expect before we arrive" checklist

**Email documentation:**
- Claim preparation checklist
- Photo upload instructions
- Insurance policy guidance
- Mitigation steps to prevent further damage

## Restoration-Specific AI Features

### Water Damage Workflow

**Emergency questions:**
- "Is the water still flowing?" → If yes: "Locate your main water shut-off"
- "How much standing water?" → Determines equipment needed
- "Is water affecting electrical systems?" → Safety warning
- "Has it been less than 24 hours?" → Mold prevention priority

**Crew dispatch details:**
- Number of air movers needed
- Dehumidifier requirements
- Extraction equipment needed
- Content pack-out requirements

### Fire Damage Workflow

**Safety prioritization:**
- "Is the fire completely out?" → Emergency services if no
- "Is it safe to enter the home?" → Structural integrity warning
- "Any family members or pets unaccounted for?" → Emergency services

**Documentation collection:**
- Fire department report obtained?
- Safe to enter clearance?
- Affected rooms list
- Content inventory priorities

### Storm Damage Workflow

**Weather-aware triage:**
- "Is the storm still active?" → Yes = schedule after storm passes
- "Is your roof leaking?" → Yes = emergency tarps
- "Are there downed power lines?" → Safety warning + utility company

**Insurance claim prep:**
- Photo documentation checklist
- Preventative mitigation requirements
- Temporary repairs guidance
- Contents protection instructions

## ROI: The Math for Restoration Companies

### Scenario: Major Hurricane Event

**Event details:**
- 2,000 calls over 48 hours
- Your current capacity: 500 calls answered (25%)
- Missed calls: 1,500 (75%)

**Revenue impact:**
- Average job value: $8,000 (mix of water, fire, storm)
- AI capture rate: 70% of missed calls = 1,050 additional jobs
- Conversion rate: 40% book inspections = 420 jobs
- Additional revenue: 420 × $8,000 = **$3.36M**

**System cost:**
- Implementation: $10,000
- Monthly service: $5,000
- First 3 months: $10,000 + ($5,000 × 3) = $25,000

**ROI:** ($3,360,000 - $25,000) ÷ $25,000 = **13,340% return**

### Even Smaller Events Pay Off

**Scenario: Summer thunderstorm outbreak**

- Additional calls: 100
- Additional jobs captured: 15
- Additional revenue: 15 × $5,000 = $75,000
- Monthly cost: $5,000
- **ROI: 1,400%**

**Break-even:** 1 additional job per month covers the entire system cost
