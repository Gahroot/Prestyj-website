You're scrolling through AI consultant websites, looking for pricing. Every page says the same thing: "Contact us for a custom quote." No numbers. No ranges. No transparency.

You're a business owner who needs AI automation—voice agents, chatbots, lead response systems—but you can't even get a ballpark figure. Is this a $5,000 project or a $50,000 project? Are you looking at $500/month or $5,000/month?

**Here's what nobody tells you:** AI consultant pricing is opaque for a reason. The rates vary wildly because the deliverables vary wildly. Some consultants build you a basic chatbot and walk away. Others provide end-to-end solutions with ongoing optimization.

**TL;DR:** AI consultant pricing in 2026 ranges from $2,999-10,000+/month for retainers, $10K-100K+ for project-based work, and $0.05-0.09/minute for usage-based models. But the real cost includes hidden fees for implementation, maintenance, LLM tokens, STT/TTS, and telephony that most consultants don't disclose upfront.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Retainer pricing:** $2,999-10,000+/month for ongoing AI consultant services
- **Project-based pricing:** $10K-100K+ depending on scope and complexity
- **Per-minute pricing:** $0.05-0.09/minute for voice AI platforms (plus hidden costs)
- **Hidden costs:** Implementation ($5K-50K+), LLM tokens, telephony, maintenance, optimization
- **Total cost of ownership:** Often 2-3x the base rate when all costs are included
- **Industry matters:** Real estate, HVAC, dental, and other industries have different pricing models

---

## The AI Consultant Pricing Landscape

AI consultants fall into three categories, and understanding which one you're talking to is crucial:

### 1. Platform Consultants (Low Base Rate, High Hidden Costs)

These consultants resell or build on developer platforms like Vapi, Retell, or Bland. They advertise low rates but bill you separately for every component.

**Typical pricing:**
- Base consultant fee: $500-2,000/month
- Platform fees: $0.05-0.09/minute
- LLM costs: $0.02-0.10/minute
- STT/TTS: $0.02-0.08/minute
- Telephony: $0.01-0.03/minute
- Implementation: $5,000-20,000 one-time

**Real monthly cost for 5,000 minutes:** $1,500-3,000/month

**The problem:** You don't know what you'll pay until you're already committed. The "low" base rate balloons with usage.

### 2. Boutique AI Agencies (Mid-Range, Better Value)

Specialized agencies that build custom AI solutions. They're more expensive than platform consultants but include more in their fee.

**Typical pricing:**
- Project-based: $15,000-50,000
- Monthly retainer: $3,000-7,000
- Implementation included: Yes
- Maintenance included: Sometimes (varies)
- Optimization included: Rarely

**Real monthly cost:** $3,000-7,000/month (more predictable)

**The advantage:** More transparent pricing, better communication, industry expertise.

### 3. Done-For-You AI Platforms (Higher Rate, All-Inclusive)

Industry-specific platforms (like Prestyj) that provide complete solutions, not just consulting.

**Typical pricing:**
- Monthly subscription: $1,500-5,000
- Implementation: $500-5,000 (often waived for annual commitments)
- Everything included: Platform, support, optimization, updates
- No usage-based billing surprises

**Real monthly cost:** $1,500-5,000/month (all-inclusive)

**The advantage:** Predictable costs, industry specialization, ongoing optimization included.

## AI Consultant Pricing Models Breakdown

### Retainer-Based Pricing

Most AI consultants work on monthly retainers. You pay a fixed fee for ongoing access to their services.

**Typical retainer ranges:**

| Consultant Tier | Monthly Retainer | What You Get |
|-----------------|------------------|--------------|
| Junior/Individual | $2,999-4,999 | Basic setup, limited support, slower response |
| Mid-Tier Agency | $5,000-7,999 | Full implementation, regular support, some optimization |
| Enterprise/Specialized | $8,000-15,000+ | 24/7 support, custom development, dedicated account manager |

**What's typically included:**
- Platform access and maintenance
- Bug fixes and troubleshooting
- Regular performance reviews
- Minor adjustments and optimizations

**What's usually NOT included:**
- Major new features or workflows
- Integration with new systems
- LLM token costs (sometimes billed separately)
- Telephony fees (sometimes billed separately)

**When retainer pricing makes sense:**
- Ongoing AI operations that need regular attention
- Businesses with evolving AI needs
- Situations where you want predictable monthly costs

### Project-Based Pricing

For one-time AI implementations like "build us a voice agent for our HVAC business," consultants quote project fees.

**Typical project ranges:**

| Project Complexity | Price Range | Timeline |
|-------------------|------------|----------|
| Basic chatbot or simple voice agent | $10,000-25,000 | 2-4 weeks |
| Multi-channel AI system (voice + chat + SMS) | $25,000-50,000 | 4-8 weeks |
| Enterprise AI implementation | $50,000-150,000+ | 2-6 months |

**What impacts project cost:**
- **Number of AI agents:** One voice agent vs. multi-agent systems
- **Integrations:** CRM, calendar, SMS, email, job management software
- **Customization:** Off-the-shelf workflows vs. custom-built solutions
- **Industry complexity:** Regulated industries (medical, legal) cost more
- **Data requirements:** Simple FAQ bots vs. RAG systems with your data
- **Testing and QA:** Basic testing vs. comprehensive QA with edge case handling

**The hidden trap:** Project-based pricing often leaves you with a system that works at launch but degrades over time. AI needs ongoing optimization, and most project fees don't include this.

### Usage-Based Pricing (Per-Minute or Per-Interaction)

Common for voice AI consultants who resell platforms like Vapi or Retell.

**Typical usage-based rates:**

| Usage Type | Rate Range | Hidden Costs |
|------------|------------|--------------|
| Voice AI (per minute) | $0.05-0.09/minute | LLM: $0.02-0.10/min, STT: $0.01-0.03/min, TTS: $0.01-0.05/min |
| Chat AI (per interaction) | $0.01-0.05/message | LLM tokens vary by complexity |
| SMS AI (per message) | $0.02-0.06/message | Telephony fees: $0.01-0.03/message |

**The real cost calculation:**

For a voice AI system handling 5,000 minutes/month:

| Cost Component | Rate | Monthly Cost |
|----------------|------|--------------|
| Platform fee | $0.07/min | $350 |
| LLM (GPT-4/Claude) | $0.05/min | $250 |
| Speech-to-Text | $0.02/min | $100 |
| Text-to-Speech | $0.02/min | $100 |
| Telephony | $0.02/min | $100 |
| **Total** | **$0.18/min** | **$900/month** |

**The consultant's margin:** They might charge you $0.15-0.25/minute "all-in" while paying the platform $0.18/minute. Their margin is thin, but you're still paying more than direct platform access.

**When usage-based pricing makes sense:**
- Low or unpredictable volume
- Testing and experimentation
- Seasonal businesses with variable call volume

**When to avoid it:**
- High, consistent volume (subscription becomes cheaper)
- Businesses that need predictable costs (usage billing varies wildly)

---

## The Hidden Costs AI Consultants Don't Tell You

This is where most businesses get burned. The base rate or project fee is just the beginning.

### 1. Implementation Costs

Getting AI live in your business isn't free.

**Typical implementation fees:**

| Implementation Type | Cost Range |
|-------------------|------------|
| Basic setup (number porting, simple workflows) | $1,000-5,000 |
| Custom workflow design | $3,000-10,000 |
| CRM integration | $2,000-8,000 |
| Multiple system integration | $5,000-20,000 |
| Custom training and prompts | $2,000-10,000 |

**Real example:** A dental practice wants an AI voice receptionist that:
- Answers the main line
- Integrates with their practice management software
- Handles appointment scheduling
- Manages patient confirmations
- Transfers complex calls to staff

**Implementation cost:** $8,000-15,000 one-time (on top of monthly platform fees)

### 2. LLM Token Costs

Every AI conversation uses tokens (words processed by the AI model). Someone has to pay for them.

**Typical LLM costs:**

| Model | Input Cost | Output Cost | Per-Minute Estimate* |
|-------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| GPT-3.5 | $0.001/1K tokens | $0.002/1K tokens | $0.01-0.03/minute |
| GPT-4 | $0.03/1K tokens | $0.06/1K tokens | $0.05-0.12/minute |
| Claude Opus | $0.015/1K tokens | $0.075/1K tokens | $0.04-0.10/minute |
| Claude Haiku | $0.00025/1K tokens | $0.00125/1K tokens | $0.005-0.015/minute |

*Estimates vary based on conversation complexity

**Monthly cost example:**
- 5,000 minutes of voice AI/month
- Average 750 tokens/minute (typical conversation)
- Using GPT-4: $0.08/minute × 5,000 = **$400/month in LLM costs alone**

### 3. Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) Costs

Voice AI needs to transcribe what you say (STT) and generate speech for responses (TTS).

**Typical STT/TTS costs:**

| Service | STT Cost | TTS Cost |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Basic (Deepgram, standard voices) | $0.01-0.02/min | $0.01-0.02/min |
| Premium (ElevenLabs, natural voices) | $0.02-0.04/min | $0.02-0.05/min |
| Ultra-premium (human-like voices) | $0.04-0.08/min | $0.04-0.10/min |

**Monthly cost example (5,000 minutes):**
- STT: $0.02/min × 5,000 = $100/month
- TTS: $0.03/min × 5,000 = $150/month
- **Total: $250/month**

### 4. Telephony Costs

Phone calls aren't free. Inbound and outbound calls have separate fees.

**Typical telephony costs:**

| Call Type | Cost Range |
|-----------|------------|
| Inbound calls | $0.01-0.03/minute |
| Outbound calls | $0.01-0.04/minute |
| Local phone numbers | $1-3/month each |
| Toll-free numbers | $2-5/month each |
| SMS (outbound) | $0.01-0.03/message |

**Monthly cost example:**
- 5,000 inbound minutes: $0.02/min × 5,000 = $100/month
- 500 outbound minutes: $0.03/min × 500 = $15/month
- 2 phone numbers: $4/month
- 1,000 SMS messages: $0.02/message × 1,000 = $20/month
- **Total: $139/month**

### 5. Maintenance and Optimization Costs

AI degrades without maintenance. Prompts need updating. Conversations need review. Edge cases need handling.

**Typical maintenance costs:**

| Maintenance Type | Cost Range |
|-----------------|------------|
| Basic monitoring and bug fixes | Included (varies) |
- Regular prompt optimization | $500-2,000/month |
- Performance analysis and reporting | $500-1,500/month |
- Adding new workflows or features | $1,000-5,000 per project |
- Ongoing training and updates | $1,000-3,000/month |

**The reality:** Most consultants charge extra for real optimization. The base fee covers "keeping the lights on," not improving performance.

## Industry-Specific Pricing Examples

AI consultant pricing varies by industry because complexity varies. Here are real examples:

### Real Estate AI Consultant Pricing

Real estate AI focuses on lead response, showing coordination, and follow-up.

**Typical pricing:**
- **Project-based:** $15,000-40,000 for lead response AI system
- **Retainer:** $3,000-8,000/month for ongoing management
- **Per-lead pricing:** $10-50/lead handled (uncommon but exists)

**Real example:** A real estate brokerage with 5 offices wants AI to:
- Respond to inbound leads immediately
- Qualify leads via SMS and phone
- Schedule showings with agents
- Follow up with nurtured leads

**Total cost breakdown:**
- Implementation: $20,000
- Monthly platform: $4,000
- LLM + telephony: $600/month
- **Year 1 total: $20,000 + ($4,600 × 12) = $75,200**

**ROI context:** If this AI helps capture 2 additional deals/month at $8,000 commission per deal = $192,000/year. ROI is 255%.

### HVAC AI Consultant Pricing

HVAC businesses need AI for emergency response, dispatch coordination, and appointment scheduling.

**Typical pricing:**
- **Project-based:** $12,000-35,000 for dispatch AI system
- **Retainer:** $2,500-6,000/month
- **Storm surge pricing:** 50-100% premium for rapid deployment (hurricane season)

**Real example:** An HVAC company wants AI for:
- 24/7 emergency call handling
- Tech dispatch coordination
- Appointment scheduling
- Storm surge capacity (10x normal call volume)

**Total cost breakdown:**
- Implementation: $15,000
- Monthly platform: $3,500
- Usage (10,000 minutes/month): $1,800/month
- Storm surge premium (2 months/year): +$5,000
- **Year 1 total: $15,000 + ($5,300 × 10) + ($10,300 × 2) = $83,600**

**ROI context:** Capturing 20 missed emergency calls/month at $400 average job value = $96,000/year in additional revenue. ROI is 115%.

### Dental Practice AI Consultant Pricing

Dental practices need appointment scheduling, confirmation, and patient communication.

**Typical pricing:**
- **Project-based:** $8,000-20,000
- **Retainer:** $1,500-4,000/month
- **Per-patient pricing:** Rare, but some charge $0.50-2.00/patient interaction

**Real example:** A dental practice with 3 providers wants AI for:
- Appointment scheduling
- Patient confirmations
- New patient intake
- After-hours answering

**Total cost breakdown:**
- Implementation: $10,000
- Monthly platform: $2,000
- Usage (2,000 minutes/month): $400/month
- **Year 1 total: $10,000 + ($2,400 × 12) = $38,800**

**ROI context:** Replacing a $45,000/year receptionist + capturing 15 additional appointments/month at $150 average value = $22,500/year. ROI is 133%.

### Home Services (Plumbing, Electrical, Roofing) AI Consultant Pricing

Home services businesses need similar AI to HVAC but with industry-specific workflows.

**Typical pricing:**
- **Project-based:** $10,000-30,000
- **Retainer:** $2,000-5,000/month

**Real example:** A roofing company wants AI for:
- Storm surge lead capture (high priority)
- Emergency repair dispatch
- Inspection scheduling
- Claim follow-up assistance

**Total cost breakdown:**
- Implementation: $12,000
- Monthly platform: $2,500
- Usage (varies wildly with storms): $500-3,000/month average
- **Year 1 total: $12,000 + ($3,000 × 12) = $48,000 (average)**

**ROI context:** One storm surge event can generate $100K-500K in revenue. AI that captures 10% more calls during storms = $10K-50K in additional revenue per event. ROI can exceed 500% for storm-heavy businesses.

## AI Consultant Pricing Comparison Table

Here's a side-by-side comparison of what you'll actually pay:

| Consultant Type | Base Pricing | Hidden Costs | Total Cost (Year 1) | Best For |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------|----------|
| Platform Consultant | $500-2,000/month | $1,500-4,000/month in usage, LLM, telephony | $24,000-72,000 | Tech-savvy teams, low volume |
| Boutique Agency | $3,000-7,000/month | $1,000-3,000/month in misc. fees | $48,000-120,000 | Businesses needing custom work |
| Done-For-You Platform | $1,500-5,000/month | $0-1,000/month (minimal) | $18,000-72,000 | Businesses wanting predictability |
| Enterprise Consultancy | $10,000-20,000/month | $5,000-15,000/month | $180,000-420,000 | Large enterprises, complex needs |

**The insight:** The "cheapest" option (platform consultants) often costs more in Year 1 than done-for-you platforms when you factor in all hidden costs and implementation.

## How to Calculate Your True AI Consultant Cost

Use this formula to calculate what you'll actually pay:

### Step 1: Base Consultant Fee
```
Monthly retainer or project fee ÷ months of use = Base monthly cost
```

### Step 2: Add Implementation Costs
```
One-time implementation fee ÷ expected months of use = Monthly implementation cost
```
*Example: $15,000 implementation over 24 months = $625/month*

### Step 3: Estimate Usage Costs
```
Expected minutes/month × (LLM cost + STT + TTS + telephony) = Monthly usage cost
```
*Example: 5,000 minutes × $0.18/minute = $900/month*

### Step 4: Add Maintenance and Optimization
```
Hours needed/month × consultant hourly rate = Monthly optimization cost
```
*Example: 5 hours × $150/hour = $750/month*

### Step 5: Total True Cost
```
Base fee + Implementation amortized + Usage + Maintenance = TRUE monthly cost
```

**Real example calculation:**
- Base consultant fee: $3,500/month
- Implementation ($15,000 ÷ 24 months): $625/month
- Usage (5,000 minutes × $0.18/minute): $900/month
- Maintenance and optimization: $500/month
- **TRUE monthly cost: $5,525/month** (58% higher than the base fee)

## ROI Calculator: Is AI Consultant Pricing Worth It?

Here's how to determine if AI consultant pricing delivers ROI:

### For Service Businesses (HVAC, Plumbing, Roofing)

**Revenue impact formula:**
```
(Average job value × Additional jobs captured) - Consultant cost = ROI
```

**Example:** HVAC company paying $4,000/month for AI
- Captures 20 additional emergency calls/month
- Average job value: $400
- Additional revenue: 20 × $400 = $8,000/month
- ROI: $8,000 - $4,000 = **$4,000/month positive ROI**
- Payback period: Immediate (first month)

### For Appointment-Based Businesses (Dental, Medical)

**Cost savings formula:**
```
(Staff cost replaced + No-show reduction value) - Consultant cost = ROI
```

**Example:** Dental practice paying $2,500/month for AI
- Replaces $3,500/month receptionist (partial replacement)
- Reduces 10 no-shows/month at $150 each = $1,500/month value
- Total benefit: $3,500 + $1,500 = $5,000/month
- ROI: $5,000 - $2,500 = **$2,500/month positive ROI**
- Payback period: Immediate

### For Lead-Driven Businesses (Real Estate, Insurance)

**Lead quality formula:**
```
(Additional leads converted × Commission per deal) - Consultant cost = ROI
```

**Example:** Real estate brokerage paying $5,000/month for AI
- AI responds to 500 leads/month (vs. 200 with manual response)
- Conversion improvement: 2% → 3% = 5 additional deals/month
- Average commission: $6,000
- Additional revenue: 5 × $6,000 = $30,000/month
- ROI: $30,000 - $5,000 = **$25,000/month positive ROI**
- Payback period: Less than 1 week

**The takeaway:** AI consultant pricing seems high until you calculate the revenue impact. For most businesses, positive ROI is achieved in the first 1-3 months.

---

## Red Flags: When AI Consultant Pricing Is a Bad Deal

### Red Flag 1: "Contact for Pricing" With No Ranges

Every consultant should provide at least broad pricing ranges. Refusing to share any pricing suggests either:
- They price discriminate (charge you more if you seem wealthy)
- Their pricing is inconsistent
- They're embarrassed by their high rates

**What to do:** Ask for "typical pricing for similar businesses." If they won't share, walk away.

### Red Flag 2: Usage-Based Billing Without Caps

Per-minute or per-interaction billing can spiral out of control without caps.

**Example:** A consultant charges $0.08/minute with no cap. You get 10,000 minutes in a storm month. That's $800 for the month instead of the expected $400.

**What to do:** Negotiate monthly caps or ask for "all-inclusive" pricing.

### Red Flag 3: Implementation Fees That Exceed First-Year Value

Paying $50,000 for implementation on a $1,000/month platform makes no sense unless you're enterprise-scale.

**What to do:** Implementation should rarely exceed 6-12 months of platform fees. If it does, ask for justification.

### Red Flag 4: No Performance Guarantees

AI consultants should stand behind their work. If the AI doesn't perform, there should be recourse.

**What to do:** Ask for performance metrics, SLAs, or at minimum, a 90-day opt-out if the system doesn't work as promised.

### Red Flag 5: Hidden LLM or Usage Costs Passed Through

Some consultants quote a low base rate but bill you separately for every LLM token, phone minute, and SMS message.

**What to do:** Ask for "all-inclusive" pricing that covers LLM, telephony, and platform costs. If they refuse, calculate your true cost including all pass-through fees.

---

## How to Negotiate AI Consultant Pricing

AI consultant pricing has room for negotiation. Here's how to get better rates:

### Strategy 1: Commit to 12-24 Months

Consultants value predictable revenue. Offering a 12-24 month commitment can get you 15-30% off monthly fees.

**Example:**
- Month-to-month: $5,000/month
- 12-month commitment: $4,250/month (15% discount)
- 24-month commitment: $3,500/month (30% discount)

### Strategy 2: Pay Upfront for Implementation

Paying the entire implementation fee upfront (instead of monthly amortization) can get you discounts.

**Example:**
- $15,000 implementation amortized over 12 months = $1,250/month add-on
- Pay $12,000 upfront instead (20% discount)

### Strategy 3: Bundle Multiple Services

If you need multiple AI systems (voice + chat + SMS), ask for a bundled rate.

**Example:**
- Voice AI: $3,000/month
- Chat AI: $1,500/month
- SMS AI: $1,000/month
- **Total: $5,500/month**

**Bundled rate: $4,000/month (27% discount)**

### Strategy 4: Leverage Industry-Specific Platforms

Generalist AI consultants often charge premiums for specialized work. Industry-specific platforms (like [Prestyj for real estate](/best-for/real-estate-teams) or [home services](/best-for/hvac)) often provide better value because they're optimized for your use case.

### Strategy 5: Start Small and Scale

Negotiate a pilot program to prove value before committing to enterprise pricing.

**Example:**
- "Let's start with 2 locations instead of all 10. If it works, we'll roll out to all locations at our agreed rate."

---

## The Future of AI Consultant Pricing (2026-2027)

AI consultant pricing will shift significantly in the next 12-24 months:

### Trend 1: Commoditization of Basic AI

Basic AI voice agents and chatbots will become commoditized. Pricing pressure will push basic solutions toward $1,000-2,000/month all-in.

**Implication:** Don't sign long-term contracts for basic AI at premium rates.

### Trend 2: Rise of Outcome-Based Pricing

Forward-thinking consultants will charge based on results, not hours or minutes.

**Examples:**
- $50 per qualified lead captured
- 10% of revenue increase attributed to AI
- Performance bonuses for exceeding targets

**Implication:** Look for consultants willing to share risk. If they believe in their solution, they should accept outcome-based pricing.

### Trend 3: Done-For-You Platforms Replace Consultants

Businesses will increasingly choose all-inclusive platforms over a la carte consultants.

**Why:**
- Predictable pricing
- Faster implementation
- Industry specialization
- No hidden costs

**Implication:** Consider platforms like Prestyj before hiring a generalist AI consultant. You'll likely get better value.

## FAQ: AI Consultant Pricing

### What's the average hourly rate for AI consultants?

Most AI consultants don't bill hourly for ongoing work—they prefer retainers or project fees. For one-off consulting, hourly rates range from $150-500/hour depending on expertise.

### How do I know if I'm being overcharged?

Compare your quote to these benchmarks:
- Basic voice AI: $1,500-3,000/month all-in
- Mid-tier solution with integrations: $3,000-6,000/month
- Enterprise with customization: $6,000-15,000/month

If you're paying $8,000/month for basic voice AI, you're overpaying.

### Are there free AI consultant options?

Some AI platforms offer free tiers, but they're limited in minutes and functionality. For business use, expect to pay. Free options are fine for testing but won't scale.

### Should I hire an AI consultant or use an AI platform?

**Hire a consultant if:** You need highly custom AI, have complex integrations, or are building AI into your core product.

**Use an AI platform if:** You want industry-specific solutions, predictable costs, and rapid deployment without building.

### How long does AI consultant pricing stay valid?

Most pricing quotes are valid for 30-60 days. AI costs (LLM tokens, telephony) change rapidly, so consultants update pricing frequently.

### Can I negotiate AI consultant pricing after signing?

It's difficult but possible. If your volume is much higher than expected, negotiate volume discounts. If the system isn't performing, negotiate performance-based adjustments.

---

## Next Steps: Getting Transparent AI Pricing

If you're tired of "contact for pricing" and want real numbers, here's your path forward:

### Step 1: Define Your Use Case

Before talking to any consultant, know what you need:
- What problem are you solving? (Missed calls, slow lead response, appointment scheduling?)
- What's your current volume? (Calls/leads per day)
- What systems need integration? (CRM, calendar, job management?)
- What's your budget range?

### Step 2: Request Detailed Quotes

Ask consultants for:
- Monthly base fee
- Implementation cost
- Usage-based costs (per minute or per interaction)
- LLM, STT, TTS costs
- Telephony fees
- Maintenance and optimization costs
- **TOTAL estimated monthly cost**

### Step 3: Calculate ROI

Use the formulas above to calculate your expected ROI. If the consultant can't help you calculate ROI, they're not focused on your success.

### Step 4: Compare Multiple Options

Talk to 2-3 consultants or platforms. Compare:
- Total cost of ownership
- Industry expertise
- Implementation timeline
- Performance guarantees
- Support quality

### Step 5: Start With a Pilot

Unless you're enterprise-scale, start small. Test the AI with one location or workflow. Scale once you've proven value.

**The Bottom Line:** AI consultant pricing ranges from $2,999-10,000+/month for retainers to $10K-100K+ for projects, but the real cost includes implementation, LLM tokens, telephony, and optimization that can double or triple the base rate. Transparent pricing exists—you just have to find consultants and platforms willing to share it.

Done-for-you AI platforms like Prestyj often provide better value than a la carte consultants because costs are predictable, implementation is included, and industry expertise is built in. Before committing to any AI consultant, calculate your true total cost and expected ROI. If the numbers don't work in 1-3 months, keep looking.
