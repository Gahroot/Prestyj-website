## TL;DR

Traditional Inside Sales Agents (ISAs) cost $5,000-7,000/month when you factor in salary, commission, benefits, and training—and they only work 8 hours a day. AI sales agents cost a fraction of this, work 24/7/365, and deliver consistent results without sick days or turnover. The smartest teams use AI to handle 80% of lead volume while reserving human ISAs for complex conversations.

## Key Takeaways

- **ISAs cost $5,000-7,000+/month** including base salary, commission (25-35% of your split), benefits, and management time
- **AI operates 24/7 with no sick days**, vacation, or turnover—eliminating the biggest ISA reliability problems
- **AI handles the 80% of lead work that's repetitive** (speed-to-lead, basic qualification, booking), freeing humans for high-value conversations
- **Same 100 leads with AI = 25-35 appointments** vs 15-20 with ISA alone, at a lower cost

You're losing leads. You know you need help. The question is: hire an ISA or use AI?

Let's look at the real numbers.

## The True Cost of an ISA

**Base salary**: $3,500-5,000/month

**Commission**: 25-35% of your split on deals they touch

**Benefits**: Add 20-30% for health, PTO, taxes

**Training**: 2-4 weeks before they're productive

**Management**: Your time reviewing calls, giving feedback

**Real monthly cost**: $5,000-7,000 minimum

And that's if they're good. Bad hire? Start over.

## The Hidden ISA Problems

### They Call in Sick
When your ISA has the flu, leads go cold. No backup.

### They Quit
Average tenure? 8-14 months. Then you're training again.

### They're Only Human
8 hours a day, 5 days a week. What about nights? Weekends? Holidays?

### Inconsistent Quality
Monday morning vs Friday at 4pm. We all have off days.

## The AI Alternative

**Monthly cost**: Fraction of ISA salary

**Commission**: None

**Hours**: 24/7/365

**Sick days**: Never

**Training time**: Under an hour

**Consistency**: Every. Single. Time.

## Where ISAs Still Win

Be honest—there are things humans do better:

- Complex objection handling
- Reading emotional cues
- Building genuine rapport
- Local market small talk

But here's the thing: how much of an ISA's day is actually spent on these high-value activities?

Most of it is speed-to-lead response, basic qualification, and booking appointments. AI handles all of that.

## The Smart Approach

Top-performing teams aren't choosing ISA *or* AI. They're using AI to handle the volume, then having humans step in for complex conversations.

Your ISA (or you) handles the 20% of conversations that need human judgment. AI handles the 80% that's repetitive.

Result? More leads handled. Better conversion rates. Lower costs.

## The Math

Let's say you get 100 leads per month.

**With ISA alone:**
- 60-70 contacted (ISA has limited hours)
- 15-20 appointments booked
- Cost: $5,000+/month

**With AI:**
- 100 contacted (AI never sleeps)
- 25-35 appointments booked
- Cost: Much lower

Same leads. More appointments. Lower cost.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does an ISA cost per month?

A real estate Inside Sales Agent typically costs $5,000-7,000+ per month when you factor in all expenses. This includes base salary ($3,500-5,000), commission (25-35% of your split on deals they touch), benefits (20-30% for health, PTO, taxes), training time (2-4 weeks), and ongoing management. Bad hires mean starting over and doubling these costs.

### What is an AI sales agent in real estate?

An AI sales agent is an automated system that handles lead response, qualification, and appointment booking for real estate professionals. Unlike human ISAs, AI sales agents work 24/7/365, respond in under a minute, never call in sick, and deliver consistent results. They handle the repetitive 80% of lead work while you focus on closings.

### Should I replace my ISA with AI?

Not necessarily replace—but augment. The smartest approach is using AI to handle volume (speed-to-lead response, basic qualification, appointment booking) while your ISA or you handle the 20% of conversations requiring human judgment. This maximizes conversion rates while reducing costs.

### What can AI sales agents not do?

AI sales agents are not suited for complex objection handling, reading emotional cues during negotiations, building genuine long-term rapport, or providing local market expertise and small talk. These high-value activities require human judgment and experience. AI handles the intake; you handle the relationship.
