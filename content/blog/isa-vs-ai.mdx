You're losing leads. You know you need help. The question is: hire an ISA or use AI?

Let's look at the real numbers.

## The True Cost of an ISA

**Base salary**: $3,500-5,000/month

**Commission**: 25-35% of your split on deals they touch

**Benefits**: Add 20-30% for health, PTO, taxes

**Training**: 2-4 weeks before they're productive

**Management**: Your time reviewing calls, giving feedback

**Real monthly cost**: $5,000-7,000 minimum

And that's if they're good. Bad hire? Start over.

## The Hidden ISA Problems

### They Call in Sick
When your ISA has the flu, leads go cold. No backup.

### They Quit
Average tenure? 8-14 months. Then you're training again.

### They're Only Human
8 hours a day, 5 days a week. What about nights? Weekends? Holidays?

### Inconsistent Quality
Monday morning vs Friday at 4pm. We all have off days.

## The AI Alternative

**Monthly cost**: Fraction of ISA salary

**Commission**: None

**Hours**: 24/7/365

**Sick days**: Never

**Training time**: Under an hour

**Consistency**: Every. Single. Time.

## Where ISAs Still Win

Be honest—there are things humans do better:

- Complex objection handling
- Reading emotional cues
- Building genuine rapport
- Local market small talk

But here's the thing: how much of an ISA's day is actually spent on these high-value activities?

Most of it is speed-to-lead response, basic qualification, and booking appointments. AI handles all of that.

## The Smart Approach

Top-performing teams aren't choosing ISA *or* AI. They're using AI to handle the volume, then having humans step in for complex conversations.

Your ISA (or you) handles the 20% of conversations that need human judgment. AI handles the 80% that's repetitive.

Result? More leads handled. Better conversion rates. Lower costs.

## The Math

Let's say you get 100 leads per month.

**With ISA alone:**
- 60-70 contacted (ISA has limited hours)
- 15-20 appointments booked
- Cost: $5,000+/month

**With AI:**
- 100 contacted (AI never sleeps)
- 25-35 appointments booked
- Cost: Much lower

Same leads. More appointments. Lower cost.
