## Red Flags: Timeline Warning Signs

### Red Flag 1: "We can do this in 2 weeks"

**Reality:** Unless it's a simple proof of concept, 2 weeks is unrealistic. AI consultants who promise lightning-fast delivery are either:
- Overselling (they'll miss deadlines)
- Under-scoping (they'll discover complexity later)
- Using cookie-cutter solutions (won't fit your needs)

**Realistic minimum:** 4 weeks for any production AI system.

### Red Flag 2: No Discovery Phase

**Reality:** Consultants who skip discovery and jump to building don't understand your business. They'll build the wrong thing, discover issues at launch, and spend weeks fixing.

**Required:** Minimum 1 week discovery for any project.

### Red Flag 3: Vague Timeline

**Reality:** "It'll take a few months" means they don't know. Good consultants provide week-by-week timelines with clear milestones and deliverables.

**Expect:** Detailed timeline with weekly milestones.

### Red Flag 4: No Buffer for Unknowns

**Reality:** Every AI project hits unexpected issues. Timelines should include 20-30% buffer for the unknown.

**Expect:** Conservative timeline with contingencies.

## Accelerating Your AI Consultant Timeline

Want to move faster? These steps can shave weeks off your timeline:

### Before Hiring (Save 1-2 weeks)

- **Define your use case clearly:** "We want AI to answer phones after hours and book appointments" beats "we want AI."
- **Document current processes:** Map out what happens now. Who does what? Which systems are involved?
- **Identify success metrics:** What does success look like? "Answer 90% of missed calls" is measurable.
- **Secure executive sponsorship:** Leadership support removes obstacles fast.

### During Discovery (Save 1 week)

- **Make stakeholders available:** Schedule interviews upfront. Don't make the consultant chase your team.
- **Provide system access immediately:** Give API keys, documentation, and system access on day one.
- **Share existing documentation:** Process docs, system docs, training materials—anything that helps the consultant understand your business.

### During Build (Save 1-2 weeks)

- **Limit scope creep:** Resist adding features mid-project. Save enhancements for phase 2.
- **Decide fast:** When consultants ask for feedback, respond within 24 hours. Delays cascade.
- **Trust expertise:** If the consultant recommends a standard approach, don't demand customization without good reason.

### During Test (Save 1 week)

- **Recruit testers early:** Have staff or customers ready to test. Don't scramble for participants.
- **Provide feedback quickly:** Test feedback within 48 hours keeps projects moving.
- **Accept 80% perfection:** Launch with 80% perfect. Optimize to 95% in production. Waiting for 100% adds weeks.

## Timeline Comparison: AI Consultant vs. DIY

| Approach | Timeline | Expertise Required | Risk |
|----------|----------|-------------------|------|
| **AI Consultant** | 4-8 weeks (standard) | None (they provide it) | Low (proven process) |
| **DIY Platform** | 8-16+ weeks | High (you build it) | High (you're learning) |
| **In-House Team** | 16-32+ weeks | Very high (you hire/train) | Very high (unproven team) |

**The insight:** AI consultants move faster because they've done this before. They use pre-built components, proven workflows, and established processes. DIY and in-house teams learn as they go—and learning takes time.

## FAQ: AI Consultant Timelines

### What's the fastest AI consultant timeline possible?

2 weeks for a limited proof of concept. 4 weeks minimum for any production system. Anything faster involves corners cut.

### Why can't AI consultants work faster?

AI requires iteration. Build something, test it, see what breaks, fix it, repeat. Rushing the process guarantees failures at launch.

### What if I need AI ASAP?

Prioritize speed over perfection. Launch a basic version in 4-6 weeks, then optimize. Waiting for perfect means waiting forever.

### Do enterprise projects really take 4+ months?

Yes. Multi-location rollouts involve change management, phased deployment, and organizational alignment. The AI tech might be ready in 8 weeks, but rolling it out to 50 locations takes 4+ months.

### Can I shorten the timeline by doing work myself?

Yes, but be careful. You can prepare documentation, define use cases, and map processes. But don't attempt AI development yourself—you'll likely create more work for the consultant to fix.

## Next Steps: Getting a Realistic Timeline

Ready to move forward? Here's how to get an accurate timeline:

### Step 1: Define Your Use Case

Be specific: "We want AI to answer phones after hours, qualify emergency calls, and schedule appointments for non-emergencies."

### Step 2: Gather Documentation

Collect: current process maps, system documentation, API docs, training materials.

### Step 3: Identify Stakeholders

Who needs to be involved? Owner? Operations manager? IT? Frontline staff?

### Step 4: Request Detailed Timeline

Ask consultants for:
- Week-by-week breakdown
- Milestones and deliverables
- Timeline risks and contingencies
- What you can do to accelerate

### Step 5: Validate References

Ask past clients: "Did they deliver on time? What caused delays? What could have accelerated the project?"
