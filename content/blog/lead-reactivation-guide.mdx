You're sitting on a goldmine. That dusty database of "dead" leads from the past 2-3 years? Up to 30% of them are ready to transact now. They just need someone to reach out.

**TL;DR:** Lead reactivation targets contacts who previously showed interest but never converted. These leads are 3-5x cheaper to convert than new leads because they already know you. A systematic reactivation campaign touching each lead 7-12 times over 30-60 days can revive 5-15% of your "dead" database.

## Key Takeaways

- **Old leads already trust you** — they raised their hand once, making them warmer than any new lead
- **Timing changes everything** — the lead who wasn't ready 18 months ago might be closing in 60 days
- **Multi-channel outreach works best** — combine calls, texts, emails, and social touches for maximum response
- **Consistency beats intensity** — a 60-day drip campaign outperforms a single "checking in" call

## What Is Lead Reactivation?

Lead reactivation is the process of re-engaging contacts who previously expressed interest in buying or selling but went cold. These aren't strangers. They're people who:

- Filled out a form on your website
- Attended an open house
- Requested a home valuation
- Started a conversation but stopped responding
- Said "we're not ready yet" 6-24 months ago

The key insight: **their situation has likely changed since you last spoke.**

Life events trigger real estate decisions:
- Job changes and relocations
- Marriage, divorce, new baby
- Kids leaving for college
- Retirement planning
- Investment portfolio rebalancing

Your old leads are experiencing these triggers right now. The question is whether you'll be the agent they think of.

## Why Old Leads Are Gold

### They Already Know You

New leads require trust-building from zero. Your database contacts have already:
- Interacted with your brand
- Received value from you (even if just information)
- Stored your name somewhere in their memory

That head start is worth money. Industry data shows:

| Lead Type | Average Cost to Convert |
|-----------|------------------------|
| New cold lead | $500-$1,500 |
| Reactivated warm lead | $100-$300 |
| Past client referral | $50-$150 |

### No Competition (Yet)

When a new lead fills out a form, 5-10 agents often contact them within hours. Your old leads aren't actively shopping yet. You can reach them before competitors even know they exist.

### Lower Resistance

These leads aren't being bombarded with sales calls. A friendly check-in from an agent they recognize faces far less resistance than a cold outreach.

## The 60-Day Reactivation System

Here's a proven process to systematically revive your database.

### Step 1: Segment Your Database (Day 1)

Not all old leads deserve equal attention. Prioritize by:

**Tier 1: High Priority**
- Leads from past 12 months
- Previously showed strong intent (toured homes, applied for pre-approval)
- High-value price ranges
- Contacted you directly (not just form fills)

**Tier 2: Medium Priority**
- Leads from 12-24 months ago
- Showed moderate interest
- Mid-range price points

**Tier 3: Long-Term Nurture**
- Leads older than 24 months
- Minimal previous engagement
- Unknown motivation level

Start with Tier 1. These are your highest-probability conversions.

### Step 2: Clean Your Data (Days 2-3)

Before reaching out, verify your information:

- **Phone numbers:** Use a validation service to identify disconnected numbers
- **Email addresses:** Remove hard bounces from previous campaigns
- **Addresses:** Confirm they haven't moved (if they have, they may have already transacted)
- **Duplicates:** Merge duplicate records to avoid embarrassing double-outreach

### Step 3: Launch Multi-Channel Outreach (Days 4-60)

The magic happens through consistent, varied touches.

**Week 1: The Soft Open**
- Day 1: Personalized text message
- Day 3: Email with market update
- Day 5: Follow-up text if no response

**Week 2: Add Value**
- Day 8: Email with relevant listing or neighborhood report
- Day 10: Phone call attempt
- Day 12: Text referencing your call

**Week 3-4: Increase Intensity**
- Day 15: "Checking in" email
- Day 18: Phone call
- Day 21: Text with specific question
- Day 25: Email with new content

**Week 5-8: Persistence Pays**
- Continue alternating channels every 3-4 days
- Total touches: 15-20 over 60 days
- Adjust messaging based on any engagement signals

### Step 4: Track and Respond Immediately

When someone engages—opens an email, replies to a text, answers a call—respond within 5 minutes. Reactivation momentum is fragile. A delayed response can lose them again.

## Scripts That Work

### Initial Text Message

> "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Brokerage]. We connected [X months ago] when you were exploring homes in [Area]. The market has shifted quite a bit since then. Are you still thinking about [buying/selling], or has the plan changed?"

### Follow-Up Email Subject Lines

- "Quick question about your [Area] search"
- "[Name], still thinking about [Area]?"
- "Something's changed since we last talked"
- "3 new listings you might have missed"

### Phone Script Opening

> "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] with [Brokerage]. I hope I'm not catching you at a bad time. We spoke [timeframe] ago about your real estate plans, and I realized I never followed up properly. I wanted to check in and see if anything has changed on your end."

### The "No Pressure" Close

> "I know timing is everything in real estate. If now isn't right, I completely understand. But when the time does come, I'd love to be your resource. Is it okay if I send you a quick market update now and then?"

## What To Do When They Re-Engage

Someone replied. Now what?

### Immediate Actions (Within 5 Minutes)
1. **Acknowledge their response** with a warm, personal message
2. **Ask one clarifying question** to gauge urgency
3. **Offer a specific next step** (call, showing, consultation)

### Within 24 Hours
1. **Add notes to your CRM** documenting the interaction
2. **Move them to an active pipeline** with shorter follow-up intervals
3. **Send something valuable** (listings, market report, article)

### Common Reactivation Responses

**"We're still not ready."**
> "Totally understand. When you picture being ready, what would need to happen? I'll make sure to check back around that time."

**"We actually bought/sold already."**
> "Congratulations! I'm glad you found something. If you don't mind me asking, what finally made the timing right? I'd love to learn for other clients."

**"We decided to stay put."**
> "Makes sense. Have you thought about leveraging your equity for anything else? A lot of my clients are doing cash-out refis or investment properties."

## FAQ

### How often should I reactivate my database?

Run a full reactivation campaign every 6-12 months. In between, maintain monthly nurture touches (market updates, newsletters) to stay top-of-mind.

### What if I haven't contacted these leads in over 2 years?

Be honest about it. "I realized I dropped the ball on staying in touch" is authentic and disarming. People respect honesty.

### Should I use automation or manual outreach?

Use automation for scale (emails, initial texts) but personalize your phone calls and responses to replies. The hybrid approach balances efficiency with authenticity.

### What's a realistic conversion rate for reactivation?

Expect 5-15% of Tier 1 leads to re-engage meaningfully. Of those, 20-30% will transact within 12 months. On a database of 500 old leads, that's 5-20 closings.
