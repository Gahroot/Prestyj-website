# The Roofer's 24/7 Lead Response Playbook
## How to Capture Every Storm Lead Without Hiring More Staff

---

## Executive Summary

Storm season creates the biggest opportunity and biggest challenge for roofing contractors. Call volumes surge 10-100x, creating thousands in potential daily revenue—but only contractors who answer first capture the jobs.

This playbook shows you how to implement 24/7 lead response that:
- Answers every call in under 60 seconds
- Qualifies leads automatically
- Prioritizes emergencies
- Books inspections directly to your calendar
- Scales infinitely during storm surge
- Costs a fraction of hiring staff or call centers

**Result:** Capture 60-80% of storm leads vs. 20-40% with manual response.

## The Economics of Speed

### What Speed Means for Revenue

The numbers are clear: first responder wins the job.

| Response Time | Lead Capture Rate | Description |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Under 60 seconds | 85%+ | Gold standard |
| 1-5 minutes | 60-70% | Good but losing ground |
| 5-15 minutes | 30-50% | Marginal |
| 15+ minutes | 10-25% | Poor |

### The Cost of One Missed Storm Call

- Average storm damage job: **$15,000**
- Average storm season jobs per contractor: **50-200**
- Revenue at stake: **$750,000 - $3,000,000**

**Every missed call isn't just a lost opportunity—it's giving that $15,000 job to your competitor.**

### The Multiplier Effect

Storm leads multiply:
- One hail event = 300-500 calls
- 3-5 major storms per season in hail-prone areas
- Contractors who respond best capture disproportionate market share

Being the first responder isn't nice-to-have—it's survival.

## Understanding Storm Lead Behavior

### Why Homeowners Call During Storms

1. **Active damage:** Water coming in, structural concerns
2. **Documentation:** Need evidence for insurance claims
3. **Fear of missing out:** Know contractors get booked fast
4. **Urgency:** Weather forecast shows more damage coming

### The Call Pattern

**Hour 1 post-storm:**
- Volume: Highest
- Urgency: Highest
- Patience: Lowest (call first available)

**Hours 2-24:**
- Volume: High
- Urgency: Still high
- Patience: Growing (checking multiple contractors)

**Days 2-7:**
- Volume: Moderate
- Urgency: Medium
- Patience: Selective (comparing quotes)

### What Homeowners Say

> "I called five contractors. The first one who answered came out the same day and I hired him on the spot. I never heard from the others."

> "I left four voicemails. Only one person called me back—two days later. By then, I'd already hired someone."

> "We have a hole in our roof and water pouring in. We don't care about reviews or price—we just need someone NOW."

## The 60-Second Standard

### Why Under 60 Seconds?

Research shows:
- After 5 minutes, qualification drops by **80%**
- 78% of buyers choose **first responder**
- Sub-60-second response captures **3-5x more jobs**

### What 60 Seconds Looks Like

**Caller:** "Hi, I think we have hail damage from the storm last night."

**AI Response (37 seconds later):**
> "Thanks for calling Apex Roofing. I'm sorry to hear you may have damage—those storms were pretty intense. Are you seeing any active leaks inside the house, or is it mainly exterior damage you've noticed so far?"

**Caller:** "No leaks inside, but shingles are all over the yard."

**AI:**
> "Got it. That definitely needs attention soon before we get more weather. I have tomorrow morning at 8am or afternoon at 2pm available for a free inspection. Which works better for your schedule?"

**Result:** Lead captured, appointment booked, human crew preserved for actual work.

### Implementing the 60-Second Standard

**Technical Requirements:**
- Webhook integration from lead sources
- Sub-5-second initiation latency
- Natural language conversation engine
- Calendar integration for instant booking
- CRM sync for handoff

**Process Requirements:**
- Immediate answer (no rings wasted)
- Conversational qualification
- Appointment booking capability
- Emergency detection and routing
- 100% uptime reliability

## Emergency Triage Protocols

### The Three-Tier System

#### TIER 1: Immediate Emergency (Dispatch Within 1 Hour)

**Triggers:**
- Active water intrusion
- Structural failure (partial collapse)
- Tree on roof
- Roof deck exposed to weather

**Response:**
- AI flags for immediate human dispatch
- SMS notification to on-call crew
- "How soon can someone be there?" booking
- Confirmation sent to homeowner

#### TIER 2: Priority (Same-Day Inspection)

**Triggers:**
- Significant storm damage (hail, wind)
- Older customers with history
- Insurance claim already filed

**Response:**
- Priority booking slots (early morning, late afternoon)
- Same-day confirmation
- Preparation checklist sent to homeowner

#### TIER 3: Standard (Next-Available Inspection)

**Triggers:**
- Cosmetic damage only
- Informational calls
- New construction estimates

**Response:**
- Standard scheduling
- Full qualification process
- Normal confirmation sequence

### Emergency Detection Scripting

AI should ask triage questions early:

> "To make sure I prioritize correctly, are you experiencing any active leaking right now, or is this damage you noticed after the storm passed?"

> "Is anyone having to use buckets to catch water right now, or is the area staying dry for now?"

> "Has any part of the roof actually blown off, or is everything still in place but damaged?"

**Based on answers:** Route to appropriate tier and scheduling protocol.

## After-Hours Response Strategy

### The 40% Problem

> **40%+ of storm calls come in outside business hours.**

Evenings, weekends, overnight—when storms hit, homeowners discover damage, and want to call immediately.

### The Gap

Traditional contractor: Closed at 5 PM. No answer until 8 AM next day.
Smart contractor: AI answers 24/7, captures lead, books appointment for first thing.

### After-Hours Protocol

**Evening (5 PM - 10 PM):**
- Answer and qualify
- Offer next-day morning appointments
- Send confirmation with photos request

**Overnight (10 PM - 6 AM):**
- Answer and qualify
- Flag for morning team review
- Send immediate confirmation

**Weekends:**
- Full qualification and booking
- Monday appointments if preferred
- Emergency dispatch if urgent

### After-Hours Script

> "Thanks for calling Apex Roofing. I know it's after hours, but storm damage doesn't wait—let me help you right now. Are you calling about damage from today's weather?"

**If emergency:**
> "I understand water is coming in—I'm going to text our on-call crew member right now and he'll call you within 10 minutes to get details and head over."

**If not emergency:**
> "I'd like to get you scheduled for an inspection first thing tomorrow morning. I have 8am or 10am available—what works for you?"

## Multi-Channel Follow-Up

### Why Multi-Channel Matters

Homeowners have preferences:
- **Phone:** For emergencies and detailed questions
- **SMS:** For quick confirmations and updates
- **Email:** For documentation and record-keeping

The best response systems coordinate across all three.

### The Follow-Up Sequence

**Immediate (0-5 minutes):**
- Phone call answered by AI
- Qualification conversation
- Appointment booked or follow-up set

**Confirmation (5-15 minutes):**
- SMS: "Your inspection is confirmed for Tuesday at 10am at 123 Main St."
- Email: Full details with map, what to expect, contact info

**Reminder (24 hours before):**
- SMS: "Quick reminder—inspection tomorrow at 10am. Still good?"
- Email: Preparation checklist (insurance documents, photos needed)

**Day-of (morning of):**
- SMS: "Crew en route, ETA 20 minutes"
- SMS: "Running 15 min behind, still on for today?"

**Post-appointment (4 hours after):**
- Email: "How did inspection go? Ready to move forward?"

**Post-appointment (24 hours later):**
- If no response: Follow-up sequence
- If disinterested: Remove from active pipeline
- If interested: Proposal workflow
