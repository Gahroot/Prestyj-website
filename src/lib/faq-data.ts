    question: "Will my leads know they're talking to AI?",
    answer:
      "No. Your agent uses natural language that feels human. We've tested extensively - leads engage just as well (often better) than with human follow-up. The conversation flows naturally, asks relevant questions, and responds contextually.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does it integrate with my existing tools?",
    answer:
      "Your agent works with your existing CRM and calendar. We support integrations with Follow Up Boss, ServiceTitan, Jobber, HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, Google Calendar, Outlook, and more. Setup typically takes less than 30 minutes.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when a lead asks something the agent can't answer?",
    answer:
      "Your agent is designed to handle the qualification conversation. For specific questions or complex scenarios, it smoothly hands off to you with full context. You get notified immediately so you can jump in when needed.",
  },
  {
    question: "How fast does it actually respond?",
    answer:
      "Our average response time is 47 seconds. That's from lead submission to first text message. Compare that to the industry average of 47 hours. Speed-to-lead is the #1 predictor of conversion.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a long-term contract?",
    answer:
      "No long-term commitments required. We believe in earning your business every month. Most clients see ROI within the first week and stay because results speak for themselves, not because they're locked in.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does it work nights and weekends?",
    answer:
      "That's the whole point. Your agent works 24/7/365. Saturday at 11pm when you're with family? It's working. Sunday morning? It's working. Holidays? It doesn't take them off.",
  },
