      question: "How does AI handle sensitive or private cosmetic procedure inquiries?",
      answer:
        "AI provides a discreet, judgment-free first contact. Patients can ask questions about breast augmentation, liposuction, facial procedures, or any cosmetic treatment without feeling embarrassed or self-conscious. The AI is professional, informative, and private—helping patients gather information comfortably before committing to a consultation.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can AI handle consultation booking for multiple surgeons and providers?",
      answer:
        "Yes. AI understands your practice structure and schedules. A patient requesting breast augmentation consultation? AI books with your breast specialist. Rhinoplasty inquiry? Routes to your facial plastic surgeon. Medspa treatment? Schedules with your aesthetician. Intelligent routing ensures every patient sees the right provider.",
    },
    {
      question: "How well does AI handle Spanish-speaking and other non-English patients?",
      answer:
        "AI speaks Spanish, Mandarin, and other major languages fluently. Non-English speakers can have full conversations about procedures, pricing, consultations, and scheduling in their preferred language. This expands your patient base and provides exceptional service to diverse communities—without requiring multilingual staff.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens when a patient has a post-op question or concern?",
      answer:
        "AI handles routine post-op questions (recovery timelines, medication instructions, normal symptoms) using your surgeon's protocols. For concerning symptoms or complex questions, AI immediately escalates to your nurse or on-call surgeon with full context. Most questions get answered instantly; true concerns reach your team immediately.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can AI book medspa treatments and manage treatment series?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. AI books individual treatments (Botox, fillers, laser, chemical peels) and manages full treatment series. When a patient purchases a package of 6 laser treatments, AI schedules the full series at optimal intervals and sends reminders before each appointment. Increased compliance and revenue without manual follow-up.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does AI handle pricing questions for cosmetic procedures?",
      answer:
        "AI provides pricing ranges for procedures based on your practice guidelines (e.g., 'Breast augmentation typically ranges from $8,000-$12,000 depending on the specific approach'). For precise quotes, AI encourages booking a consultation where the surgeon can provide an exact quote based on the patient's needs. This balances transparency with the need for clinical assessment.",
    },
    {
      question: "What about HIPAA compliance for plastic surgery practices?",
      answer:
        "Prestyj is fully HIPAA-compliant. All patient conversations are encrypted, data is stored securely, and we maintain complete audit trails. We provide a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) as part of onboarding. Patient information is never exposed, and call recordings are retained per your compliance policy.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can AI handle financing questions for cosmetic procedures?",
      answer:
        "Yes. AI can explain your financing options (CareCredit, Alphaeon, in-house payment plans) and provide general information. For detailed financing applications or complex questions, AI can transfer to your financing coordinator or direct patients to complete applications online. Every patient gets financing information before their consultation.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much revenue can we recover by capturing after-hours calls?",
      answer:
        "The average cosmetic surgery practice misses 20-30% of incoming calls during business hours and nearly 100% after hours. With average procedure values of $5,000-$15,000, capturing just 5 additional missed calls per month can mean $25,000-$75,000 in recovered monthly revenue. AI ensures every call is answered and every qualified lead is captured.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does AI integrate with our practice management and scheduling software?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Prestyj integrates with major practice management systems including EMR platforms, scheduling software, and patient communication tools. AI reads availability in real-time, books appointments directly into your system, and syncs all patient information and conversation notes automatically.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if a patient wants to speak to a human?",
      answer:
        "AI seamlessly transfers to your front desk, nurse, or coordinator when requested, providing full conversation context and notes. For routine tasks (appointment confirmations, basic questions, rebooking), most patients prefer the instant service of AI. When they want human interaction, the handoff is seamless with zero repeat information.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does AI handle competitive patients shopping multiple providers?",
      answer:
        "Speed and professionalism win. AI responds immediately (under 10 seconds), provides helpful information, and offers to book a consultation—often before competitors even answer their phones. The polished, informative experience positions your practice as responsive and professional, increasing conversion rates for shopping-around prospects.",
