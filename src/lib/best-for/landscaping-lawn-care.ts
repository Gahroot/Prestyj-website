      question: "How does AI qualify landscaping job types?",
      answer:
        "AI asks targeted questions: What services do you need? Is this residential or commercial? What's the property size? Is this one-time service or ongoing maintenance? Based on answers, AI qualifies by job size, value, and urgency—routing appropriately.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can AI distinguish between maintenance calls and project estimates?",
      answer:
        "Yes. AI identifies whether the caller needs routine maintenance (mowing, cleanup, trimming) or project work (hardscape, installation, design). Maintenance calls get scheduled automatically while estimate requests route to you for site visits.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does AI handle after-hours emergency calls?",
      answer:
        "AI answers all calls and assesses urgency. For true landscaping emergencies (storm damage, irrigation failure), AI reaches your on-call staff according to your protocols. Routine requests get scheduled for the next available time.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can this integrate with landscaping business software?",
      answer:
        "Prestyj integrates with major landscaping management systems including LMN, Aspire, Jobber, and RealGreen. Customer data, appointments, and job details sync automatically with your existing workflow.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does AI handle seasonal call volume spikes?",
      answer:
        "That's exactly what AI is built for. Unlike human staff who can only handle one call at a time, AI answers unlimited calls simultaneously. Whether it's spring cleanup calls or fall leaf removal requests, every caller gets immediate, helpful response.",
    },
    {
      question: "What about customers who want to speak to a person?",
      answer:
        "AI seamlessly transfers calls to your staff when requested, providing full conversation context. For straightforward scheduling and information, most customers appreciate instant automated service over waiting on hold or leaving voicemail.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can AI handle recurring service scheduling?",
      answer:
        "Yes. AI can set up recurring lawn care schedules, manage service reminders, and handle rescheduling requests. Customers can establish ongoing service without multiple calls to your office.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does route optimization work with AI?",
      answer:

    },

      question: "Can AI provide pricing information?",
