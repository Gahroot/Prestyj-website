      question: "Can AI really replace a human ISA?",
      answer:
        "For lead qualification, initial response, and follow-up: yes. AI handles these tasks with greater speed and consistency. For complex negotiations and in-person rapport, humans still excel. Prestyj handles the high-volume qualification so you can focus on the high-value personal interactions.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much can I actually save?",
      answer:
        "A typical ISA costs $4,000-6,000/month in salary plus 15-25% commission on closed deals. If you close 20 deals at $10,000 average commission, that's $30,000-50,000 in commission splits alone. Prestyj eliminates the commission split entirely and costs a fraction of the salary.",
    },
    {
      question: "What about leads that need a human touch?",
      answer:
        "AI identifies when leads need human interaction and seamlessly hands off to you or your agents. You get the qualified, appointment-ready lead with full conversation context. You handle the high-value conversations; AI handles the volume.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is AI response quality as good as a trained ISA?",
      answer:
        "Prestyj AI is trained on millions of real estate conversations and follows your exact scripts and qualification criteria. Unlike human ISAs who have good days and bad days, AI delivers identical quality every single time.",
    },
    {
      question: "How fast can I switch from my current ISA?",
      answer:
        "Prestyj can be deployed in minutes. Many agents run AI alongside their ISA during transition, then phase out the human role as they see AI performance. There's no disruption to your lead flow.",
